## About

In this project, I explore the limitations of pooled fitness assays (such as TnSeq) in inferring gene essentiality by simulating fitness assays and re-analyzing data from my previous preprint on fitness landscapes and gene essentiality in the long-term evolution experiment. 

## Organization
